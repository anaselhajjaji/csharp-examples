The C# language is evolving and we have mostly each year a bunch of new interesting features in the language.

The error most C# developers is that they keep using C# in a default usage that’s why I had the idea to create a C# project that summarize all the interesting features of the language by version.

It’s actually a simple console application so you can build, debug and explore the C# features directly using the IDE.
